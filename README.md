# Sort-of-Art
A browser-based creative tool that uses sorting algorithms to transform your images into unique glitch art. This app takes the structured, logical process of sorting and applies it to pixel data, creating beautiful and unexpected visual effects. It's "sort of" methodical, and "sort of" art.
